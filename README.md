MPSec(Multipath Security) uses [mptcp protocol](https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp), a multi-path transmission technology, to provide highly reliable networking that can effectively cope with network failure situations.

In addition, it has the following additional functions.

* **Environment configuration is very simple through Docker.**
* Real-time monitoring using `Backoffice` enables users to manage effectively.
* Packets are encrypted by `IPSec`.
* Network speed is improved when communicating with similar bandwidth.
* Compatibility is good because it is possible to communicate with tcp protocol.

Please check Project details for more information.
